## CS61A

Welcome to 61A!!

My section times are:

You can sign up / leave (if there is space) [here](https://sections.cs61a.org).


I staff [OH](https://oh.cs61a.org) at some unspecified time right now, but if you have more personalized questions you should [email me](mailto:catherinegee@berkeley.edu) or try [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ks2ailfmg2upx). I can also set up appointments on an email basis as needed! 

**Slides:**
Right now I am not planning on making slides but we will see. However, you can access all my slides from last semester below and I'll update this website if I do end up making slides!
